1)
- I would say the "coordinates" are Interval - not norminal.
- .. And "Relative humidity" and "wind" are ratio (even though the dataset doesn't include 0-valued observations).
- Maybe we can summarize this in a table :)

2)
- Maybe mention, that the BUI and FWI have been discarded since they are dependent of the other values in the FWI-system.

3)
I think we should exclude 'area' from the attributes, since this is an output variable.
